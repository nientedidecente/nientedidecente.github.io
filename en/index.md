# NDD GAMES

> Niente di decente

(=Nothing fancy) used to be the answer to the question:

> Oh, so are there games on Linux as well?

In 2020 not anymore, games are usually supporting multiple platforms, even some triple As, and all thanks to the hard work of Open Source Communities.

That is what **NDD Games** is trying to be.

A community of videogames enthusiasts who can't only focus on playing games, but also want to create some new ones.
