## Who are we?

We are just a bunch of guys who replied to a reddit post in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/giby9r/community_italiana_game_developer_open_source_ii/)(ITA).

We're people from various backgrounds and different ages.

We are **coders**, **musicians**, **students**, **professional**, but more importantly, gamers.

More info in [here](./team).

## What do we do?

We are still working on it, at the moment we have setup:

- A [Discord](https://discord.gg/ysJUrSm) server, where we all hangout most of the time.

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/nientedidecente) org, where we plan to collaborate over gamedev projects.

- This blog made with github pages.

## What do we want?

The aim of any community is, obviously to hangout and collaborate with people with same interests.

Our community is no different, and aside the basic, we have the main aim of creating a small virtual hub to get together people who wants to create videogames or people who wants to learn how to do one collaborating on existing projects.

It does not really matter if you know how to code or not, the only prerequisite is that you need to share our same passion.
