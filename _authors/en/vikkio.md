I am a sicilian who lives abroad (West Yorkshire, England).
I was born in 1988 and I have been doing things on computers since 1991. I studied *Computer Science* at [Palermo's University](https://unipa.it) but please don't ask me about it. I have been working since 2007 in Software Engineering, especially in the Web Development field.

I have worked for many different companies, always abroad, and in different industries: Betting, News, E-Learning/Education, Hospitality, Retail and Sport Streaming.
I currently work for [DAZN](https://dazn.com).

When I am not writing **php** or **javascript** at work, I spend my spare time writing yet more code on sideprojects to cram into my [github](https://github.com/vikkio88).
