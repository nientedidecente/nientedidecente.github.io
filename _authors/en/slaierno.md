Born in 1990, raised as a [*terrone*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrone) and [bolognese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) by choice. I am one of those kids that always had a computer to play with.

My house first computer was a [Commodore Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500). There is a picture of when I was a year and half old where I am on my father laps while he was playing a videogame. Another picture, a year later, I was next to him, with the player 2 joystick controlling a jeep a giving support to my father's helicopter in [Silkworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkworm_\(video_game\)).

Just before my school start, my father bought a PC. "For helping me with my studies" he said to my mother. [Giochi per il Mio Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giochi_per_il_mio_computer) was an encyclopedia, I guess. And [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_\(1996_video_game\)) was there to help my with history assignments, right?

Besides from videogames, the whole computer world always fascinated me. I initially played the role of the house sysadmin, and during my high school I discovered the world of computer programming. It was too fun not to dig further into that world.

I studied Computer Engineering and graduated at the [Alma Mater Studiorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna). My main area was computer vision and I studied a bit of artificial intelligence and FPGA programming. I also developed an interest in programming languages theory.  
I always made sure to avoid any networking course like Neo with the bullets. Then, of course, I ended up working in the TLC area, developing software for LTE and 5G infrastructures in the cutting edge programming language [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language\)).

What about videogames? Always been there next to me, still a part of my everyday life.

During my free time I try to work on a small project in C++17/20 because it is too fun to play with such a twisted language, ending up cursing at the usual template error. So masochistic.

On my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/slaierno) you can find my only personal public project, because the other 19 ~~are too incomplete~~...*the world is still not ready for them*.
