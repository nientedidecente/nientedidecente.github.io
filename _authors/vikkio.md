Sono un terrone (Siciliano) che vive all'estero (West Yorkshire, Inghilterra). Sono nato nel 1988 e faccio roba sui Computer dal 1991. Ho studiato *Ingegneria Informatica* all'[Universit√† degli Studi di Palermo](https://unipa.it), ma non ne voglio parlare. Lavoro dal 2007 nel mondo del Software Engineering, sopratutto in campo web.

Ho lavorato per diverse aziende, sempre all'estero, in diversi settori: Betting, News, E-Learning/Education, Hospitality, Retail e Sport Streaming. Attualmente lavoro per [DAZN](https://dazn.com).

Quando non scrivo **php** o **javascript** a lavoro, passo il tempo libero scrivendo altro codice per intasare il mio [github](https://github.com/vikkio88) di sideprojects.

I am a sicilian who lives abroad (West Yorkshire, England).
I was born in 1988 and I have been doing things on computers since 1991. I studied *Computer Science* at [Palermo's University](https://unipa.it) but please don't ask me about it. I have been working since 2007 in Software Engineering, especially in the Web Development field.

I have worked for many different companies, always abroad, and in different industries: Betting, News, E-Learning/Education, Hospitality, Retail and Sport Streaming.
I currently work for [DAZN](https://dazn.com).

When I am not writing **php** or **javascript** at work, I spend my spare time writing yet more code on sideprojects to cram into my [github](https://github.com/vikkio88).
