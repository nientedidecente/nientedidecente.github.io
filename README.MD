# How to set up the blog and test it by yourself?

1. Install `ruby`
2. Install Jekyll and Bundler:
    `gem install jekyll bundler`
3. Clone this repo on your local folder
4. In the repo root run
    ```
    bundle install
    bundle update
    bundle exec jekyll serve`
    ```
5. You can find the blog hosted locally at http://localhost:4000
6. Ask on the discord server if something went wrong (which seems quite likely)
